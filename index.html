        <p>Gaming is Very fun, its also addicting, but some games exmaple: FreeFire, Pubg and Bmgi is very very 𝐻𝒜𝑅𝑀𝐹𝒰𝐿𝐿 for people's brain, in short, avoid these games. I love Mincraft, but Minecraft is not a simple game for 3 year old, the game is filled with hidden lore, not that lore but the lore of gaming, its hidden knowledge from the game, not knowledge of real life, but something like........ just take the example. <br> EXAMPLE: The neather fortresses are made for wither skeletons and blazes, both mobs for beating game bosses, but who built them, why and what are the wither skeletons and blazes? <br> This is an example of gaming lore.</p>
